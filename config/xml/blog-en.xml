				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/forecasting.html#ixzz3maqCFo2f" target="_blank">Business Dictionary</a> defines <strong>forecasting</strong> as a planning tool that helps management in its attempts to cope with the uncertainty of the future, relying mainly on past and present data, and trend analysis. In other words: predicting the future. For merchants, of course, this boils down to predicting sales.<br />
Many small businesses don’t think investing in forecasting early on is essential, but in fact, it can be a big help in determining performance, and predicting and maintaining future growth.<br />
<span id="more-20813"></span><br />
If you’ve ever looked at last month’s revenue to gauge how much you’ll make the next month, then you’ve already started forecasting. In this blog article, we’ll walk you through the basic forecasting process and suggest resources for going further with more in-depth forecasting. How much you can forecast is ultimately determined by the amount of data you have, so if you’ve been in business for 3 years, your sales forecast will be more accurate and comprehensive than someone who has been in business for 3 months.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5b">No History Forecast</h2>
<p>Most businesses starting out will establish this type of forecast. This is a critical step in building a <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-create-an-online-store-10-steps-to-write-your-business-plan/">business plan</a> and an important factor that potential investors will consider. With no data, this forecast is pretty much just a guess. But you can use relevant information to make an educated guess. Research your industry and similar companies you’d like to emulate. Understanding how others in your field have performed can help you gauge how your own business will perform. Other considerations include: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Your track record (How successful were your previous ventures?) </li>
<li>Partner’s success rate (Are you bringing someone on board with a better success rate?) </li>
<li>Product Demand (Compare purchasing behavior and purchasing funnel) </li>
</ul>
<p>Your local chamber of commerce and other small business organizations can help you with your projection based on their experience with similar companies. The more research you have, the more accurate your predictions will be. </p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5b">1 Month History Forecast</h2>
<p>Once you’ve made your first month’s sales, it’s easy to guess what the next month will look like.  Barring any major fluke events, this method will give you a ballpark sales figure. Unfortunately, it’s not always a very reliable method. An obvious example is the holiday season: if you make $1500 in sales during the holiday season, you can’t reasonably expect to maintain the same level of sales in the months after; the holidays are an unusual event in the ecommerce sales year that tend to show increased sales. So remember, this forecast can give you a general idea of sales, but you’ll need to take context into account.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5b">3-Month History Forecast</h2>
<p>Collecting data for several months will give you a more accurate forecast by allowing you to average your sales across this period. You’ll also have enough data to start seeing trends. Here’s a short video on creating a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFxm-1smXjM" target="_blank">trendline in Excel</a>. Whether you have been experiencing an increase or decrease in sales, it helps to plot your sales on a graph to really “see” where they’re going.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5b">1-Year History Forecast</h2>
<p>If you continue to plot your sales throughout the year, you’ll start to see a clearer sales trajectory. However, you might also notice clear rises and drops in sales across different seasons. This is mostly due to high sales seasons around the holidays and the lack of sales during slow seasons like summer. In forecasting, this is called seasonality. To forecast next quarter’s sales, calculate the annual average and sales averages for each of the quarters. Now divide each quarter’s sales by the average.  Next, estimate the amount you expect to make the following year. Take that prediction and multiply it by the effect seasonality plays on your business. The result is the estimated quarterly sales.</p>
<p>See below for an example using 11.8% annual growth. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/tab-guide-en.png" alt="tab-guide-en" width="479" height="233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20815" /></p>
<p>For another approach, check out this <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2014/12/17/how-to-adjust-your-business-data-for-seasonality/" target="_blank">Forbes’</a> how to article.</p>
<h2>Multi-year History Forecasting</h2>
<p>Once you collect data across multiple years, you’ll see that you no longer have to estimate the following year’s growth. You’ll be able to solve for that using previous years’ numbers, essentially removing almost the guesswork in your forecast. Once you accumulate that data, we recommend creating an excel spreadsheet with all your sales information. Then use built in functions to create a table that will automatically provide sales information. We suggest reading this article on <a href="http://www.exceluser.com/excel_dashboards/seasonality-sales.htm" target="_blank">creating a rolling forecast of seasonal sales in Excel</a>. Again, it will require that you have extensive data to feed into the spreadsheet. Once you do, you’ll have a pretty accurate projection for next month’s sales.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5b">Why Small Businesses Should Forecast</h2>
<p>If you’re just starting out, forecasting sales is a critical step in putting together your business plan. Once you’ve been in business for some time, it’s forecasting is useful to predict sales. However, forecasting can be great tool for many other business functions: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Forecasting expenses</li>
<li>Inventory reordering </li>
<li>Product performance (new products)</li>
<li>Evaluate new marketing efforts </li>
<li>Revenue forecast (Sales &#8211; expenses)</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:#251b5b">Flawed Forecasts</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that with any predictions, there are some underlying assumptions you may take for granted. Forecasts do not account for extenuating circumstances like natural disasters or any crashes in the overall market or even your industry. Keep in mind that forecasts provide numbers; it’s up to you to interpret the information correctly. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holiday season brings with it some of the year’s most pleasant opportunities for celebration: snow days, if you’re lucky, and time off to spend with friends and family. This is also the time most businesses make most of their sales. From trinkets to lavish gifts, shoppers are in the mood to buy gifts. Online retailers face the annual challenge of delivering goods in time for the holidays. As part of our 2015 holiday guide, we’re helping you succeed this season with shipping deadlines from 3 of the top US carriers.<br />
<span id="more-20827"></span><br />
The mad dash for holiday gifts generally happens during and after Black Friday. With so many great deals, it’s hard to pass up the opportunity to save.  If you’re guaranteeing delivery by the holidays&#8211; Christmas to be exact&#8211;it’s important to note the shipping cutoff dates. Packages shipped after these dates will unfortunately&#8211;and to the disappointment of your customers&#8211;arrive after the holidays. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/calendar.png" alt="calendar" width="625" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20831" /></p>
<p>When you’re marketing your sales and delivery guarantees, be sure to consider the amount of time it will take for you to process the increased number of orders. Consider enlisting additional help or simply factor in more processing time.</p>
<h2 style="color:#c33d3a">Shipping Speeds and Deadlines</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/shipping-speed-deadlines.png" alt="shipping-speed-deadlines" width="464" height="433" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20829" /></p>
<p><em>*Trademarks: All trademarks and registered trademarks are the property of their respective owners.</em></p>
<h2 style="color:#c33d3a">Delays</h2>
<p>Regardless of which shipping provider you select, there’s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-27/ups-shipping-delays-show-perils-of-stores-overpromising" target="_blank">always a chance your package</a> will be delayed. From snowstorms to misplaced packages, it’s unavoidable and can happen to anyone. Take matters into your own hands by shipping as early as you can. This way you’ll still have time to expedite another package to your customer should any unforeseen problems arise. </p>
<p>If you really can’t get your products shipped early you’ll be relying on your carrier’s promise to delivery the packages on time. In the event your package isn’t delivered on time, you can file a claim to get a refund on your shiping. To automate this process, consider adding <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/shipping-logistics-delivery-prestashop-modules/19096-71lbs-fedex-ups-shipping-refunds.html" target="_blank">71 lbs’ shipping refunds module</a> to your shop &#8211; it’s free to install and you will only be billed for 50% of the claims they win. </p>
<h2 style="color:#c33d3a">International Packages</h2>
<p>Ship early. The only thing certain about international shipping is that nothing is certain! Each country has a own unique process, be it for deliveries to US embassies and military bases or residences. Every international package must pass customs, regardless of who is moving it. Missing paperwork, outstanding taxes and fees, flags for full inspections or even misplaced packages can cause delays even your shipping carrier can’t anticipate. </p>
<p>After the package has successfully passed customs, it is either passed to a local shipping carrier or the local offices of your domestic carrier. If it gets passed along to a local carrier, keep in mind that you may not receive additional tracking information. </p>
<h2 style="color:#c33d3a">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Planning your shipping strategy plays a key role in your holiday success. Keep customers happy by giving them plenty of time to shop for gifts and receive them in time for the holidays. For a detailed description of each carrier’s shipping schedule, please refer to their holiday schedules listed below: </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can you optimize navigation and motivate more visitors to make purchases on your site? Product datasheets, referencing tags, product filters, favicon, payment are a few places to start. This week, learn all you need to know with our audit of <a href="http://www.dimplesanddandelions.co.uk/" target="_blank">DimplesandDandelions</a>, a British online boutique offering adorable, affordable toys!<br />
<span id="more-20788"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#f05881">3 tips to customize your store and optimize navigation</h2>
<h4 style="color:#9bd5c4">Strong points:</h4>
<p>The site’s soft colors instantly plunge visitors into the world of childhood. Everything appeals to parents&#8217; emotions, from the main visual of children on the homepage, to the use of the term &#8220;pre-loved.&#8221;</p>
<p>This responsive site is optimized for all devices (mobile phones, tablets, computers), which is perfect for the target audience, who tends to navigate from a smartphone.</p>
<p>The &#8220;back to top&#8221; button is a very convenient way to navigate through long pages. Adding it was a good idea. Since <a href="http://www.dimplesanddandelions.co.uk/" target="_blank">DimplesandDandelions</a> offers attractive products, they shouldn’t hesitate to feature more of them on the homepage!</p>
<h4 style="color:#9bd5c4">Optimization strategies:</h4>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>
		<strong>Customize the favicon</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The favicon is one of the first impressions visitors have of your site.</p>
<p style="color:#5b9bd5;font-style:italic">What&#8217;s a favicon?<br />
An icon that symbolizes a website. Web browsers use this icon to display your site on the site tab, address bar and title bar, in bookmarks, etc.
</p>
<p>To customize your favicon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to a <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/" target="_blank">favicon generator</a>.</li>
<li>You have two options: either design your favicon yourself, or create a square icon (in .gif, .jpeg or .png format) and import it. Use a recognizable element of your logo.<br />
	The generator then saves your favicon in .ico format.</li>
<li>Once your favicon has been generated, you can save it in your store’s back office, in Preferences / Themes / Icons.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/2.FaviconEN-1024x513.png" alt="2.FaviconEN" width="700" height="350" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20791" /></p>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>
		<strong>Introductory phrase and referencing tags</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Sum up your store&#8217;s activity in one phrase on your homepage, so visitors know exactly what they’ll find there. For example: &#8220;Favorite children&#8217;s toys,&#8221; &#8220;Best children&#8217;s toys,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>As for referencing, it&#8217;s essential that the tags you entered for your store’s natural referencing (meta title, description, etc.) correspond exactly to your business. </p>
<p>List your keywords (children&#8217;s toys, etc.) and use them to write your referencing tags.<br />
This part can be customized in your back-office: Preferences / SEO &amp; URLs / Index.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20792" alt="3.SEOEN" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/3.SEOEN_-1024x371.png" width="700" height="253" /></p>
<p>Here’s a reminder about reference tag character counts:</p>
<p style="color:#5b9bd5;font-style:italic">Title tag: 60 characters (including spaces)<br />
Meta Description tag: 160 (including spaces)</p>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>
		<strong>Disabling the product comparison chart</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>If not all of your products can be compared (doll and coloring book, etc.), don&#8217;t hesitate to disable the comparison chart for your store, to avoid error messages and customer disappointment.</p>
<p style="color:#5b9bd5;font-style:italic">To disable the product comparison chart for your store in the PrestaShop 1.6 version, go to your back-office. In Preferences / Themes, click &#8220;Advanced settings.&#8221; In the &#8220;Appearance of columns&#8221; block, search for the &#8220;Products comparison&#8221; line, and disable the active columns.</p>
<h2 style="color:#f05881">3 tips to increase your conversion rate</h2>
<h4 style="color:#9bd5c4">Strong points:</h4>
<p>Free delivery as stated on the homepage provides a strong incentive to view the catalog. It’s an excellent argument that is clearly showcased!<br />
The purchasing funnel on a single page (&#8220;one page checkout&#8221;) is also fast and clear. And having 3 different delivery options meets the needs of all your customers, from the most frugal to the most impatient.</p>
<h4 style="color:#9bd5c4">Optimization strategies:</h4>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>
		<strong>Classify the products</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>There are currently 5 main categories, which can be found in the menu (on every page) and also at the top of the left-hand column. General information is also duplicated: in the menu and in the left-hand column.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/5.-Category-1024x691.png" alt="5. Category" width="700" height="472" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20789" /></p>
<p>By offering faceted navigation from this column, you will help your visitors find the gift they need.</p>
<p style="color:#5b9bd5;font-style:italic">With faceted navigation, your visitors can refine their search in just a few clicks to easily find products that meet their needs (size, color, age, style, price, etc.). This tool will help you increase your conversion rate. Find filters that correspond to your products.</p>
<p>Faceted navigation is perfect for gift ideas. Take advantage of it! For example, offer filters to find your products by age, by gender (girl, boy, mixed), by price range, etc. There are countless examples.</p>
<p class="text-center" style="margin: 30px 0">
	<a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/510-search-filters" target="_blank" style="color:#df0067;font-size:16px;text-decoration:underline">View product filter modules</a>
</p>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>
		<strong>Optimize the product page</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.dimplesanddandelions.co.uk/" target="_blank">DimplesandDandelions</a> displays products using high-quality visuals that really tempt visitors to place an order. However, some products could benefit from more information to help finalize the purchase. Take the example of this adorable reindeer: </p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/4.-Product-1024x679.png" alt="4. Product" width="700" height="464" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20793" /></p>
<p>There are several options to make it more appealing:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>Add a visual in its context (with a child) so that visitors immediately understand the product&#8217;s function and have an idea of its size.</li>
<li>Add the product&#8217;s dimensions and material in the detailed description.</li>
<li>Add a video of the product.</li>
<li>Add badges to product datasheets (e.g. &#8220;very soft,&#8221; &#8220;develops motor skills,&#8221; &#8220;ideal for outdoor play&#8221;).</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-center" style="margin: 30px 0">
	<a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/465-badges-logos" target="_blank" style="color:#df0067;font-size:16px;text-decoration:underline">View badge and logo modules</a>
</p>
<ul style="padding-left:30px">
<li>
		<strong>Payment methods and reassurance</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently only the PayPal logo appears in the footer, even though in the shopping cart, visitors are given the opportunity to pay for their order with a credit card on the PayPal site. This can be a deterrent for some of your visitors, who think they need a PayPal account to be able to pay. </p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, over 88% of online buyers make their transactions with a credit card, versus almost 8% with PayPal. Don&#8217;t hesitate to appeal to this vast majority of potential customers by clearly stating that you accept card payments and also by adding a popular payment method by card in addition to payment on the PayPal platform. </p>
<p class="text-center" style="margin: 30px 0">
	<a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/482-payment-by-card-or-wallet" target="_blank" style="color:#df0067;font-size:16px;text-decoration:underline">View credit card payment modules</a>
</p>
<p>Good luck and happy selling as the winter holidays draw near! </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In our last post, Leah Hamilton from Terms Feed walked us through the essentials of customer privacy protection compliancy. Today, she’s going to tell us how to apply security best practices to your PrestaShop store.</em><br />
<span id="more-20743"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#50b0be">How to Display a Privacy Policy in your Store</h2>
<p>Once you’ve written your privacy policy, the next important thing is to ensure that your customers can actually agree to it in a way that is legally binding. There are two main ways that you can get your customers to agree to your privacy policy: <strong>clickwrap</strong> and <strong>browsewrap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Browsewrap</strong> is used most often:  the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use are displayed in small links at the bottom of the page. Here’s an example from USAToday:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/usa-today-footer.png" alt="usa-today-footer" width="954" height="357" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20744" /></p>
<p><em>Image: USA Today Footer (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/</a>)</em></p>
<p>The browsewrap method is not legally binding, as the customer is just <em>presumed</em> to have read the policy and agreed to it. A better method to ensure that you get agreement is clickwrap.</p>
<p><strong>Clickwrap</strong> requires the customer to click “I agree” in some way, whether it’s a button or tick box. Here’s an example from the PrestaShop One Step Checkout. You can see the link to the Terms of Service at the top of the Delivery Methods column:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/ps-one-step-checkout.png" alt="ps-one-step-checkout" width="901" height="725" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20747" /></p>
<p><em>Image: PrestaShop One Step Checkout</em></p>
<p>You can see that the customer has to click “I agree” to the Terms of Service before they can proceed with the purchase. There is also a link to the policy visibly displayed, so it is easy for them to read. <strong>This method is generally legally binding, as it’s easy to see that the customer has <em>expressly</em> agreed.</strong></p>
<p>PrestaShop has a number of modules that you can use to ensure that you get agreement in other ways, such as the <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/front-office-features-prestashop-modules/8123-data-privacy-extended-data-protection-law-lopd.html" target="_blank">Data Privacy Extended Module</a>. This module allows you to display a popup when your user accesses your store, and uses a tick box to get agreement. Here’s an example of what this might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/ps-data-privacy.jpg" alt="ps-data-privacy" width="1000" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20746" /></p>
<p><em>Image: PrestaShop Data Privacy Extended Module (<a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/front-office-features-prestashop-modules/8123-data-privacy-extended-data-protection-law-lopd.html" target="_blank">http://addons.prestashop.com/en/front-office-features-prestashop-modules/8123-data-privacy-extended-data-protection-law-lopd.html</a>)</em></p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at some of the other ways in which you can protect customer privacy in your PrestaShop store.</p>
<h2 style="color:#50b0be">Security Measures</h2>
<p>The other side of the coin in protecting customer privacy in your store is ensuring that you have good security measures in place. </p>
<h4 style="color:#50b0be">SSL</h4>
<p>The first step is to ensure that your website is secure when the customer accesses it with their browser. You can do this by using SSL. SSL is a way for computers to encrypt messages that they send to other computers. On your PrestaShop store this means it allows the store to communicate with the customer’s browser in encrypted messages, which prevents other people from ‘listening in’ and extracting data. This ensures that any private customer information passed between the customer and your store is kept safe.</p>
<p><strong>PrestaShop has a <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/guest-blogger-series-prestashop-ssl-installation-troubleshooting/">great tutorial</a> on how to obtain an SSL certificate, check that it’s working, and troubleshoot any problems. </strong></p>
<h4 style="color:#50b0be">Internal Content Management</h4>
<p>The next thing you can do to ensure your customers’ data is kept safe is to only collect what you need. For example, if you are only going to contact your customers by email and send items to their physical address, don’t also collect their business address and phone number. </p>
<p>Then, ensure that anyone dealing with customers’ private information is doing so on a “need to know” basis only. This will keep information secure and leave fewer opportunities for information to be lost or leaked.</p>
<p>PrestaShop also has a number of content management modules that you can use to streamline your content management processes. For example, you can use <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/content-management/7152-custom-fields.html" target="_blank">form generators</a> to create custom fields to ensure that you collect only the most relevant information for your purposes, or use the <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/content-management/4514-product-questions.html" target="_blank">product questions module</a> to allow customers to ask questions in your store directly, rather than having to contact you and share their personal information unnecessarily.</p>
<h4 style="color:#50b0be">Cloud Storage</h4>
<p>The next thing you need to do is ensure that you choose a reputable cloud storage provider for when you are storing your customer data.</p>
<p>With PrestaShop, you can create a <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=25198687" target="_blank">PrestaShop cloud</a> store that already includes hosting, management tools, and administration panels. It allows you to start up your store with a reputable host provider and to manage your store with the PrestaShop cloud back-office. The back office has information on orders, customers, shipping, pricing, and stats, among other things. Here’s an example of what the back office looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/ps-cloud-bo-1024x529.png" alt="ps-cloud-bo" width="700" height="361" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20745" /></p>
<p><em>Image: PrestaShop Cloud Back Office (<a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/CLOUD/Managing+your+PrestaShop+Cloud+store" target="_blank">http://doc.prestashop.com/display/CLOUD/Managing+your+PrestaShop+Cloud+store</a>)</em></p>
<p>If you don’t want to use the PrestaShop Cloud, you <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/CLOUD/Differences+between+PrestaShop+Cloud+and+the+self-hosted+version" target="_blank">can self-host your store</a> and manage your data backups yourself or through a third party. <strong>As noted above, if you do this ensure that you choose a reputable host and storage provider.</strong></p>
<h2 style="color:#50b0be">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With PrestaShop, it’s easy to set up a store that is safe and secure for your customers, which can help your business to build trust and thrive. By setting up a comprehensive privacy policy, ensuring that your customers agree to it, and putting strong security measures in place, you will be able to protect your customers’ privacy and keep them coming back!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aspiring artists know that the first sign of having “made it” is getting noticed by an art gallery. It’s a medical student’s equivalent of receiving their coat or a lawyer passing the bar. Everything leading up to that point is about cultivating a unique design and wondering if this career choice was a sustainable one. However, getting into a gallery isn’t the only way to succeed. In today’s success story, we share how PrestaShop merchant Glennys created her successful career as an artist-turned-entrepreneur.<br />
<span id="more-20780"></span></p>
<p>Glennys has been developing her style and cultivating a unique approach to creating art since she began painting in the 1990s. Inspired by her surroundings, Glennys creates pieces that evoke fond memories of summer vacations and the abstract interpretations of the beauty she sees in nature. She presented complete portfolios of her art but was criticized for her unique, eclectic style.</p>
<p>It was an uphill battle that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Galleries ask for a 50% commission on all sales, which would have forced Glennys to price her pieces much higher to allow her to make a living off of her art. Glennys soon realized that selling art through a gallery was not meant for everyone, especially her.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20784" alt="GlennysGallery3" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/GlennysGallery3.png" width="767" height="519" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://glennyscastro.gallery/index.php?id_product=161&amp;controller=product&amp;id_lang=1">Surf and Turf</a> &#8211; 40” X 60” Mixed Media on Canvas $2,160</strong></p>
<h2 style="color: #3f4d67;">Becoming an Entrepreneur</h2>
<p>Without a gallery to display her work, Glennys had only herself to rely on for promotion. She networked at her children’s schools and sports practices, even at restaurants. By taking the initiative in her community, Glennys established a name for herself on her home island of Puerto Rico. Thanks to her new connections, she had the opportunity to design t-shirts and jewelry and collaborate on fashion projects. Glennys realized that she was a natural entrepreneur. It’s that realization that made her decide to display her art by herself, after all she was already doing all the promoting. She quickly found that it would be too expensive for her to maintain a traditional gallery, but what about a digital gallery?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20783" alt="GlennysGallery2" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/GlennysGallery2.png" width="800" height="250" /></p>
<h2 style="color: #3f4d67;">Launching an online shop</h2>
<p>Glennys reached out to a friend who was already running an online shop powered by PrestaShop. “Her lack of technical abilities reassured me that I’ll be able to use the platform too,” jokes Glennys. “Once we decided on the platform, I worked with a local freelancer, Rey Castillo, to put together my website. He held my hand through the entire website set up, ensuring that all my questions (no matter how basic) were answered. His top recommended modules were: Google Analytics, PayPal USA and the visits and visitors dashboard. Once the basic shop was set up, it was easy to add products and improve the SEO by filling in the Meta information.”</p>
<h2 style="color: #3f4d67;">Making the first sale</h2>
<p>After the digital gallery had launched, Glennys promoted the “show” through all her offline channels. She then turned to online marketing by starting her Facebook page, then launching a blog. An online blog let her express in words both her personal journey and the story of her art. Her honest posts helped her grow her audience both locally and internationally, online. More people from the community started getting to know Glennys and her art. Customers started popping by her studio to pick up art and Glennys paintings were finally finding homes. Her first online sale came through just three months after the website launched. She shares, “It was an amazing feeling to have the online gallery finally succeed not just as an online shop, but also as a gallery for local shoppers.”</p>
<h2 style="color: #3f4d67;">Future Plans</h2>
<p>Although things have started falling into place, Glennys has not slowed down. She regularly adds to her inventory and develops new collections to keep her website fresh. She also posts regularly on her blog and social media to keep her customers engaged and updated on her latest projects.</p>
<p>When asked what the best part of launching an online shop was, Glennys shared: “Launching my online shop allows me to be my own boss, a salesperson, an entrepreneur, a teacher, a mom, a wife and, of course, the artist behind each and every piece in the gallery.” <a class="twitter-share-button" href="https://www.twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Launching%20my%20online%20shop%20allows%20me%20to%20be%20my%20own%20boss%2C%20a%20salesperson%2C%20entrepreneur%2C%20teacher%2C%20%20mom..%22&amp;via=PrestaShop">Tweet_Button</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today we welcome back Leah Hamilton, from Terms Feed, for the first of a two-part series dedicated to customer privacy protection.</em></p>
<p>Protecting customer privacy in your PrestaShop store is paramount: without establishing key protections for your customers, you won’t be able to build customer trust, and without customer trust your business won’t grow. There are a number of simple ways that you can increase privacy measures and ensure that your PrestaShop store is safe and secure for your customers and visitors. Let’s get started!<br />
<span id="more-20739"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#50b0be">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to set up is a good privacy policy. But what makes a good privacy policy?</p>
<p>The primary factor that determines what goes into your privacy policy is what your local data protection laws require. Let’s take a look at two major jurisdictions, the US and the EU. </p>
<p><strong>The US has no overarching data privacy law. This may make it seem like it’s easy to comply with the law (because there is none!), but there are a few pitfalls to be aware of.</strong></p>
<p>The US has three main pieces of legislation that cover data protection and privacy in more discrete areas: HIPAA, COPPA, and OPPA. HIPAA is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act#Privacy_Rule" target="_blank">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a>; COPPA is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" target="_blank">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</a>; and OPPA is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" target="_blank">California Online Privacy Protection Act</a>. OPPA is the most important piece of legislation to comply with in the US, unless your store specifically targets children (in which case you also need to comply with COPPA).</p>
<p>OPPA states that operators of commercial websites that collect the personal information of California residents must post a distinct and easy-to-find link to the website’s privacy policy. The policy must outline:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>the kind of information gathered by the website;</li>
<li>how the information may be shared with other parties;</li>
<li>the process the user can use to review and make changes to their stored information; and</li>
<li>the policy’s effective date and any changes made since.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember that OPPA applies to all California residents, so while you may not be based in California, if your customers are, then you will need to ensure that your store is compliant.</strong></p>
<p>Many websites will have a dedicated California Privacy Notice, while others will include a clause within their overarching Privacy Policy. Here’s an example of a California Privacy Notice within a Privacy Policy, from NVIDIA:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/nvidia-privacy-policy.png" alt="nvidia-privacy-policy" width="671" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20740" /></p>
<p><em>Image: NVIDIA Privacy Policy (<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/privacy_policy.html" target="_blank">http://www.nvidia.com/object/privacy_policy.html</a>)</em></p>
<p>The Privacy Notice above requests that users write in to view the information, but the Privacy Policy itself on NVIDIA’s website covers the kinds of information gathered by the website and how the information may be shared with other parties.</p>
<p><strong>Now let’s take a look at some of the EU laws.</strong></p>
<p>The law currently in place in the EU is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive" target="_blank">EU Data Protection Directive 1995</a>. This directive sets out a number of data collection principles. These principles are:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Customers must be notified when you collect their data;</li>
<li>Personal data should only be collected for specific (and lawful) purposes;</li>
<li>The data collected should be adequate and relevant for the purpose;</li>
<li>Personal data should be accurate and kept up to date;</li>
<li>Personal data should not be kept for longer than necessary;</li>
<li>Appropriate security measures should be put in place;</li>
<li>Personal data must not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory also ensures an adequate level of protection for that data.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a new data protection regulation is coming into force in the EU. This is called the <strong>EU Data Protection Regulation</strong>. This Regulation will cover the whole EU region, replacing the patchwork of rules that exists in each individual country. The purpose is to make things easier for businesses to operate in the EU region without having to understand and comply with different sets of local laws.</p>
<p>This regulation will have much broader reach than just the EU &#8211; it will apply to anyone who deals with the private data of EU citizens. This means that US-based PrestaShop stores with EU customers may still need to comply with this regulation. The finer details of the regulation are still being worked out, but if you think this may apply to you it’s definitely something to look into further so that you can ensure you are compliant. </p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, if you are based in the EU, ensure that your store complies with the data protection principles set out above.</strong></p>

<h4 style="color: #79c6e4">2. Pick the right category</h4>
<p>If your module is relevant for a limited number of countries, that also means it concerns a local issue for merchants, which should be one of the following:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20762" alt="EN-Cat" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/10/EN-Cat.png" width="1024" height="313" /></p>
<h4 style="color: #79c6e4">3. Let us get your idea</h4>
<p>Let’s discuss to see what local modules are worth developing! To do so, please submit your <a href="https://addons.prestashop.com/en/integration-fund" target="_blank">form</a> in English or French only, otherwise we will not understand each other <img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all get them &#8212; email newsletters. Whether you love the discounts they contain, or hate that they pile up like junk in your inbox, it’s safe to say that you’ve seen your fair share. Most people don’t give a second thought to how these emails are created, but as you start to draft your own email newsletters, you’ll find that there’s more to them than meets the eye. To help you launch your own awesome email marketing campaign, today we’re sharing some advice on how to craft marketing emails that convert.<br />
<span id="more-20731"></span> </p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Newsletter Content</h2>
<p>Before you start writing anything, be it code or marketing content, the first step is to figure out what you want to say. Ask yourself, “What message do I want to convey to my customers?” Some examples include:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Shop our sale!</li>
<li>Check out today’s deals</li>
<li>Here are the new products for this season or holiday</li>
<li>New product launches</li>
<li>We’ll be at this appearance / event next</li>
<li>We have new partnerships</li>
<li>The latest industry news</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the message, it’s important to know what you’re trying to say before you do anything else. Once you know what you want to say, you can draft the email content. Be sure to use a voice that resonates with your <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-develop-buyer-personas-for-b2c-ecommerce-marketing/">buyer’s persona</a>, but keep it short so you don&#8217;t lose your customer’s interest. The exact length of your content will be determined by your email design, but more on that later.</p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Call to action (CTA)</h2>
<p>After you know what you want to tell your customer, figure out what you want the customer to do next. For example, if you’re announcing your next event, do you want customers to buy tickets, RSVP or simply share the news? </p>
<p>Clearly identifying what you want your customers to do will make it easier for you to guide them there. Once you do so, you ‘ll need to identify the landing page that will allow customers to complete that action. Continuing with our previous example, if you want customers to RSVP for your event, provide the link where they can do so.</p>
<p>Finally, create a CTA button that drives users to the link. The CTA should contain enticing text that encourages the reader to click. <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/30-call-action-verbs-online-store/">Verbs are a great start; check out this article</a> for some examples.</p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Email subject lines</h2>
<p>Once you’ve put together the message and know what you want your customers to do, it’s time to work on getting customers to open your email. The subject line is the most important line of text you’ll write for each email, and it is also the shortest. The goal of the subject line is to entice readers to open the email while accurately describing what’s inside.</p>
<p>Keep track of the subject lines you use and review them over time to ensure you’re optimizing your subject lines for conversions. </p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Newsletter design</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, each email newsletter should have a great design. Create a basic template that you’ll use time and time again. The design should include your logo in the header and a footer at the bottom that has your contact info, social media buttons and most importantly, a link to unsubscribe from your emails. While you&#8217;re designing your template, remember that it should reflect not just this email’s message but your overall brand. This includes deciding on a color palette, and the types of headers and fonts you’ll use consistently.</p>
<p>The body of your email should contain the elements we’ve worked on already: the content and call to action button. It should also feature gorgeous product photos that appeal to the customer and make your email more clickable. You can choose to have just one message or supplement a main feature with other articles. If you choose to have more than 1 segment, make sure you highlight each with bold headlines.</p>
<p>For some examples from PrestaShop merchants, check out this article to see our <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/top-10-ecommerce-newsletters-of-2014-from-prestashop-merchants/">favorite newsletters from in 2014</a>.</p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Mobile-Compatible</h2>
<p>Another key factor to consider are your mobile customers. Be sure your content can be scaled down to a smartphone’s screen size. Most of today’s <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/search?id_category=0&amp;search_query=newsletter" target="_blank">email marketing tools</a> have this functionality already built into the software. For a complete list of industry solutions available for your region please refer to our <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners">partner pages</a>. </p>
<p>Use images that are sized properly to cut down on loading time. Also, be sure to give the images a descriptive name, just in case they don’t appear onscreen; otherwise your customers might wonder what 2356450x.jpg refers to&#8230; </p>
<h2 style="color:#319ea5">Next Steps</h2>
<p>For more ideas, check out what your competitors or suppliers have used in their emails. Haven’t subscribed to emails yet? <a href="http://milled.com/" target="_blank">Milled</a> has a great collection of emails which you can filter by brand and category. To jump right in and get started here’s a recap of the steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Decide on the message </li>
<li>Draft the content</li>
<li>Figure out your customer’s next steps</li>
<li>Create a call to action</li>
<li>Write a catchy subject line</li>
<li>Select an email marketing tool</li>
<ol style="margin-top:0">
<li><a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/search?id_category=0&amp;search_query=newsletter" target="_blank">via a Module</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/industry-partners">via a 3rd party tool</a></li>
</ol>
<li>Design a great-looking newsletter</li>
<li>Send! </li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a successful business owner, you’ll find that you never quite have enough time. Whether it’s making changes to your site, taking care of customers or just taking some time for yourself, there’s always more to be done. Today we’re helping you get back some of your time by showing you how to pack and ship more efficiently.<br />
<span id="more-20728"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#eba32b">1. Identify bottlenecks</h2>
<p>The first step to improving any process is identifying bottlenecks. A bottleneck in this context refers to any activity that operates at a slower rate than all other activities in your operation. These slow-downs are generally easy to identify in warehouses because of the accumulation of orders that occur around  that operation. Depending on the complexity of your business activity, you may not have any bottlenecks or many! </p>
<p>If you don’t see any bottlenecks right away, try spending a few days observing how orders are processed. You’ll be able to spot any inconsistencies in the process that could use improving. If after a few days, you’re still unable to identify a specific bottleneck, consider ways to improve your entire operation instead. </p>
<h2 style="color:#eba32b">2. Refine the process</h2>
<p>If you have multiple bottlenecks, prioritize them from major to minor issues. You can choose to prioritize them by cost spent or time wasted. Organize it in the way that makes the most sense for your business. We’ll tackle the large issues first, because resolving larger issues may also clear up the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Find ways to remove the first bottleneck by improving the time it takes to complete the associated action or limiting the number of errors created. Ask yourself: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>What part of this step isn’t necessary? What can I remove?</li>
<li>Can part of this step be completed later in the process?</li>
<li>Can part of this step be completed earlier in the process?</li>
<li>Can part of this step be combined with another task?</li>
<li>Is there a faster way to execute this task? </li>
<li>What additional resources can expedite this process?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this basic warehouse process in mind as we run through a couple of examples of how you can improve your business processes. </p>
<p><em>(1) Print packing lists → (2) pick orders → (3) print orders → (4) pack orders → (5) weigh package → (6) print shipping label → (7) off to the mailman</em></p>
<h4 style="color:#eba32b">Removing a step</h4>
<p>If you’ve been with the company for a long time, this is generally the hardest solution to find. All tasks, even those that seem obvious to you, must be evaluated. For a new perspective, consider having a new trainee make these suggestions. </p>
<p>In the example listed above, consider the 1st task, print packing lists. If packing lists are not needed for your company, you can simply print orders forms and pack customer orders using that document. This cuts down on both the time and resources spent on printing the packing list. </p>
<h4 style="color:#eba32b">Moving parts of a step</h4>
<p>There are some parts of your process that can be grouped with other tasks to maximize efficiency. Consider any action that takes away from the seamlessness of a process. For example, when  a product runs out while you’re packing orders, do you have to go and pull more inventory from storage? This is fine when you don’t run out of inventory, but if you run out of inventory multiple times during the day, it disrupts the flow of the process. Each time something runs out, the pack order process is paused so the inventory can be restocked.  </p>
<p>To make the order packing process more seamless, you create an inventory restocking process and move it the to the beginning of the day. It appears to add a new step to your overall process, but you’re simply defining a substep that is done regardless. By doing so, you clarify the overall process and make the order picking step more efficient. </p>
<h4 style="color:#eba32b">Refining a step</h4>
<p>Sometimes it’s about improving upon a process that you already have in place. Sometimes you need to take a step back to see how you can make your process better. In our example, look at the “weigh package” step. If you already have the products on hand, you can weigh the product in advance and enter them in your PrestaShop store so that labels are automatically generated with the corresponding weights. This may not completely eliminate the “weigh package” step because you’re still weighing each product, but your order packing process is now more efficient. </p>
<h4 style="color:#eba32b">Additional resources</h4>
<p>Your last resort improvement is to call upon additional resources. This option should be considered last because it is not only more expensive to implement, but it’s bit like cutting corners to improve your shop’s efficiency. However, once you’ve exhausted all your options, it can be the only improvement left to make. If you find that all the steps are running as efficiently as they can, yet you’re still not able to fulfill orders on time, consider hiring another employee to help with the overall shipping process. Additionally, you can acquire new tools to expedite specific tasks. This can be anything from purchasing better printers to expedite the printing to or new carts to expedite order picking. </p>
<h2 style="color:#eba32b">3. Measure</h2>
<p>Once you know what you want to improve in your shop and how you want to approach the task, it’s time to implement. However, to know how well the changes are or are not working, you have to put some type of measurement tool in place. For example, you can measure the amount of time each step takes to complete. Additionally, you can count the number of orders processed each day. Either way, be sure you have something to compare your old process’s effectiveness against the new. </p>
<h2 style="color:#eba32b">In a nutshell</h2>
<p>Improving your shop’s operations is a continual process. There’s always new technology or ideas that can help you improve the way your shop works. All you need is a little time, some patience and a drive to want to be better. To make your business more effective: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Define your bottleneck, or problem</li>
<li>Refine that process and make it better</li>
<li>Measure your changes</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>What changes do you plan on making to your shop before the crazy holiday season? Let us know in the comments below. Already made some changes? Share some of the results you’ve found. </p>

<p>Here’s what we love: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">
	<strong>- Specific tools</strong> for each function helps you narrow down the features you’ll need for each type of editing need. For example, the design tab gives you easy access to templates that are perfect for each social media platform.<br />
	<strong>- No ads and a minimized menu</strong> gives way to a large editing area so you have more screen space dedicated to photo editing.<br />
	<strong>- Mobile versions available.</strong> The software is not just available online; you can also download it from from the App store and Google Play.
